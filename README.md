# My Simple Workout Tracker (work in progress!)
This is a workout tracker that I made for own purpose usage. Since I did not find any suitable application for my puproses I decided to develope it by myself.

## Tools
Frontend: TypeScript, Next.js, RTK, RTK Querry, Ant Design, D3.js, Styled Components, Day.js.
Backend: Express.js, MongoDB.
Deployment: Docker (WIP).

I chose Next.js to get more practice of it, but actually it's not the best choise for this specifically mobile like app.
Also I implemented internationalization by my own.

I did not spend much time on making backend codebase neat since frontend is my specialization and I'm not really interested in backend.

## Run locally
To run it locally you have to have [Backend](https://github.com/Sv1nnet/mswt-server) installed.
Then:
1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm run dev`
